# World Weather Analysis
 
## Overview
The purpose of this project was first to create a large list of randomized global locations using latitude and longitude numbers. The citipy module was then used to locate the nearest city to each of these randomized locations. With these city names, [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API was called to retrieve and display the current weather information. Google Maps API was then used to retrieve and display the nearest hotels in cities with temperatures within a user defined maximum and minimum tempterature.

Finally, four locations were chosen within a country and using Google Maps API directions layer, a travel itinerary with directions was created and displayed.
